# ChatGPT API
This is an Exemple of integrating chatGPT API with Nest.js

### Endpoints
The API has a single endpoint, /ChatGPT/complete, which accepts POST requests and requires a JSON payload in the request body with the following format:

```json
{
  "question": "Your question here",
  "model": "text-davinci-003",
  "temperature": 0.9
}
```

- question: A string that represents the question or prompt you want the API to complete.
- model: A string that represents the model you want to use to generate the completion. Default: text-davinci-003.
- temperature: A number that represents the temperature of the model's outputs. A higher temperature will result in a more diverse and unpredictable response, while a lower temperature will result in a more conservative and accurate response. Default: 0.9.
The API will return a JSON response with the completion generated by the specified model.

### Environment Variables

The API requires the following environment variables to be set:

- `ORGANIZATION_ID`: ID of your OpenAI organization.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key.

### Running the API
To run the API locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository.
Install the dependencies: `npm install`.
Set the environment variables.
Start the API: `npm run start`.
The API will be available at http://localhost:3000/.
